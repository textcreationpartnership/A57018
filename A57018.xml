            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Piece, we have here a ſecond Subject for our no leſs Admiration, which is, his Graces truly wonderful nimble way of Confutation: <hi>The Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Humble Servant</hi> (as he pleaſes to call him) being ſomewhat a Diſſenter from his G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aces good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a <hi>Toleration,</hi> has made it, in that ſhort An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, his endeavour to remind the World of all thoſe Diſtractions and Miſeries, Rebellion and Regicide, the Murder of the beſt of Kings, and the Subverſion of three flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that all entred at no other Door than of a <hi>Toleration;</hi> and how inevitably the ſame Inlet would bring the ſame Inundation o're again; And therefore how juſt and Reaſonable it is in the Government (contrary to his Graces opinion) to make the Strongeſt of Fences againſt ſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and fatal a Torrent. To all which, his Grace moſt Ingeniouſly Replies, <hi>My Nameleſs, Angry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have Read you over and over, and find, that neither I underſtand you, nor you me. You miſtake the meaning of His Majeſties Promiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and are very unlucky in three Letters of the</hi> French <hi>Word</hi> Opiniatre; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I adviſe you Write</hi> Engliſh: And ſo by way of Short and Sweet, defends his Darling Opinion of a Toleration, againſt all the Anſwerers objections, and the whole Sence of the Government, and Law-Makers upon that Important point, down from <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and all this to the Total Rout and Defeat of his unknown Adverſary, with a Victory as expeditious and entire, as the greateſt turn of State in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal.</hi>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->And poſſibly His Grace may affect this more than Ordinary way of Anſwering in the Lump, as being too Great to ſtoop to the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of particulars, with ſo unequal a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant.</p>
            <p>However, I am much Aſtoniſh'd to hear his Grace ſay, <hi>To my Confuſion I muſt own, That I am not able to comprehend what part of my Diſcourſe it is you do Anſwer; nor in all yours what it is you mean: But in this you are even with me, for I perceive you do as little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any part of what I have Written, tho I thought it had been in ſo plain a Style, that a Child of Six years old might very well have done it.</hi> Now the unknown Author is no leſs confounded than his Grace, to think that any part of his Anſwer ſhould be ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unintelligible, eſpecially to ſo penetrating a Reader as his Grace; neither can he for the Soul of him find himſelf guilty of any ſuch ſtrange miſunderſtanding of his Graces meanings, in a Stile (by his own confeſſion) adapted even to the Intellects of Readers of Six years old; unleſs his Graces intention in the publication of that Piece was wholly for the Inſtruction of Readers of that <hi>minor Claſs;</hi> and therefore he takes it ill that any thing more ſuper-annuated ſhould be intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with what nothing concerns them. Neither can this Anſwerer be made ſenſible, wherein (as his Grace charges him) he wilfully miſtakes his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties promiſe to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the true meaning of which (his Grace is pleaſed to tell us) appears to be, <hi>That he would not ſuffer any Body to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Church of</hi> England, <hi>but he did not promiſe that he would have the Church of</hi> England <hi>Perſecute every Body elſe.</hi> As I remember, his Majeſties promiſe was,

               <hi>To defend and ſupport the Church of</hi> England. But how this unbounded Toleration of his Graces can conſiſt with the ſupporting the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he would do well to inſtruct us, unleſs the unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wolves can be the Defence of the Flock, and the giving a full Looſe to all the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Bontefeus and Underminers of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Government, be maintaining and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it.</p>
            <p>But not to be wholly contradictory to his Graces opinion; as his Grace is pleaſed to expreſs his great difficulty of Believing himſelf the ſame <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> which he was Twenty Years ago, there indeed I muſt joyn with him; it being too apparently true, that his Grace has not been the ſame Five Years ago that he was Twenty Five; which all Men that have had the Honour of knowing his Grace at <hi>Whitehall</hi> in 60, and at <hi>Dowgate</hi> in 80, will juſtifie for me, where I leave his Grace, and am</p>
